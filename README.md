1. oop Package
This package demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including:

Abstraction: Mammal is an abstract class, providing a template for common methods (makeSound, move).
Inheritance: Dog and Cat classes inherit from Mammal.
Polymorphism: Mammal references (Dog and Cat) are used polymorphically, allowing dynamic method invocation.
Encapsulation: Mammal has a private name field with a public getter.
Interfaces: Animall interface defines a contract for makeSound, implemented by subclasses.

2. task Package
This package adds further OOP and functional programming practices, including:

Inheritance and Overriding: Monkey and Donkey inherit and override methods from Animal.
Encapsulation: Animal has private fields (age, weight) with public access methods.
Polymorphism with Collections: A List<Animal> stores different animal types, showcasing polymorphism.
Streams and Lambda Expressions: AnimalsFilter uses Java Streams for filtering animals by age.
Upcasting and Downcasting: Demonstrated for accessing subclass-specific methods while using a superclass reference (Animal).
